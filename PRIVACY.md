###_Last updated: April 2013_ 
Microsoft Open Technologies Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected through Microsoft Open Technologies Inc. Application Gateway for iOS 1.0  and the Microsoft Open Technologies Inc. Application Gateway  for Android (“AppGateway”).  It focuses on features that communicate with the Internet. It does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services. 

## Collection of Your Information
We collect many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can. Some of this information you provide directly to us. Some of it we get by observing how you interact with our products and services. Some of it is available from other sources that we may combine with the data we collect directly. Regardless of the source, we believe it's important to treat that information with care and to help you maintain your privacy.  
The personal information we collect and store includes Windows Azure Active Directory Username and password.

## Use of Your Information
Microsoft Open Technologies Inc, uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. Information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information collected through other Microsoft services to give you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with us. We may also supplement this with information from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies to help us derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.   

## Collection and Use of Information about Your Computer
When you use software with Internet-enabled features, information about your computer ("standard computer information") is sent to the Web sites you visit and online services you use. We use standard computer information to provide you Internet-enabled services, to help improve our products and services, and for statistical analysis. Standard computer information typically includes information such as your IP address, operating system version, browser version, and regional and language settings. In some cases, standard computer information may also include hardware ID, which indicates the device manufacturer, device name, and version. If a particular feature or service sends information to Microsoft, standard computer information will be sent as well.  
The privacy details for each AppGateway feature, software or service listed in this privacy statement describe what additional information is collected and how it is used.

- With other Microsoft controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. 
- As part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
- With vendors or agents. Specifically, we may share it with companies we've hired to provide services on our behalf. When we share information with these other companies to provide services for us, they are not allowed to use it for any other purpose and must keep it confidential. 

We also may share or disclose personal information, including the content of your communications:

- To comply with the law or respond to legal process or lawful requests, including from law enforcement and government agencies.
- To protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including enforcing the terms governing your use of the services.
